# Linear Issue Starship Integration
# Add this to your ~/.config/starship.toml
#
# SETUP:
#   1. Copy this section to your starship.toml
#   2. Ensure 'issue' is in your PATH
#   3. The module appears when .issue file exists in current directory
#
# The prompt shows clickable OSC 8 hyperlinks in supported terminals
# (kitty, iTerm2, WezTerm, Windows Terminal, etc.)

[custom.issue]
command = "issue prompt"
when = "test -f .issue"
format = "[$output]($style) "
style = "bold purple"
shell = ["nu", "-c"]
description = "Current Linear issues"

# Alternative: Show all issue IDs instead of count
# [custom.issue]
# command = "issue prompt --ids"
# when = "test -f .issue"
# format = "[$output]($style) "
# style = "bold purple"
# shell = ["nu", "-c"]

# Alternative: Without hyperlinks (for terminals that don't support OSC 8)
# [custom.issue]
# command = "issue prompt --no-links"
# when = "test -f .issue"
# format = "[ $output]($style) "
# style = "bold blue"
# shell = ["nu", "-c"]
